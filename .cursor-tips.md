# Cursor Integration Tips

## Viewing Pre-commit Errors in Cursor

When pre-commit hooks fail, here are the best ways to see and fix errors in Cursor:

### 1. **Run Commands Manually in Cursor Terminal**
   - Open Cursor's integrated terminal (`` Ctrl+` `` or `View > Terminal`)
   - Run the same commands the hook runs:
     ```bash
     pnpm check:staged    # Check only staged files
     pnpm type-check      # Check all types
     pnpm lint            # Check all linting
     ```
   - Errors will automatically appear in Cursor's **Problems** panel (View > Problems or `Cmd+Shift+M`)

### 2. **Use the Problems Panel**
   - After running commands, open Problems panel (`Cmd+Shift+M`)
   - Click on any error to jump to the file and line
   - ESLint and TypeScript errors are automatically parsed

### 3. **Before Committing**
   - Run `pnpm check:staged` to see what the pre-commit hook will check
   - Fix errors shown in Problems panel
   - Then commit normally

### 4. **If Pre-commit Fails**
   - The hook will show errors in the terminal
   - Copy the error output
   - Run `pnpm check:staged` manually to see errors in Problems panel
   - Fix errors and try committing again

### 5. **Quick Fix Commands**
   ```bash
   # Check everything
   pnpm check
   
   # Check only staged files (what pre-commit does)
   pnpm check:staged
   
   # Auto-fix linting issues
   pnpm lint --fix
   ```

## Pre-commit Hook Behavior

The pre-commit hook uses `lint-staged` which:
- Only checks **staged files** (faster)
- Auto-fixes linting issues when possible
- Shows clear error messages
- Blocks commit if errors remain

## Troubleshooting

If you need to skip hooks temporarily (not recommended):
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

But it's better to fix the errors using the methods above!
